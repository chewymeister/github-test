Answer: A branch is a listing system that contains a list of all the commits of a repository made to that branch. Branching is typically used when adding new features or for experimentation. An original copy of code can be maintained in the master branch while you create new features or experiment with code in a new branch (renamed to "new_features" and "experimentation" for example).
